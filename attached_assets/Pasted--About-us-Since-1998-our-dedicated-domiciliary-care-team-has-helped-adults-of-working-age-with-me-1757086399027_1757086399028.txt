What is domiciliary care?
Domiciliary care is a support option that lets you receive personalised care in your own home.
Domiciliary care gives you the opportunity to receive expert support in your own home. The package of care required will be individualised based on a thorough specialist assessment of needs – every individual will have their own package set of care needs, which makes it important to have full flexibility over the support that you receive.

Domiciliary care is for people with all types and levels of need. Here are some of the many reasons why home care is such a popular support option:


One-to-one care
Domiciliary care gives you the opportunity to receive personal one-to-one support from your own carer, meaning you’ll always have their undivided attention


A familiar environment
Most individuals wish to remain in the comfortable surroundings of their own home whilst receiving the additional support they need


Personalised support
Domiciliary care allows you to enjoy a personalised support plan that ensures you’re always getting the ideal amount of assistance for your needs and activities.


Maintain routines and favourite activities
From board games to shopping, receiving care at home means you’ll be able to continue with the routines and activities you enjoy the most


Spend more time with your family and friends

How do I know when I need support and care?
The aim of domiciliary care is to maintain independent living that the client is used to. There is no set time, health condition or diagnosis to consider help at home from a professional domiciliary care provider. It is just that moment in time when you feel that you need extra support to carry out your daily tasks and maintain your day to day comfort.

Struggling with otherwise ‘normal’ routines

Unwilling to move to a care home

Feeling lonely or isolated

Nowadays, domiciliary care is  a popular option as opposed to moving to residential care because it allows you to remain in the home that you love
